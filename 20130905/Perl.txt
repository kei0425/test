 Perl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language.
 Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix 
 scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many 
 changes and revisions and become widely popular amongst programmers. Larry Wall 
 continues to oversee development of the core language, and its upcoming version, 
 Perl 6. Perl borrows features from other programming languages including C, shell 
 scripting (sh), AWK, and sed.
